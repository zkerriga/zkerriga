### About me :sparkles:
I've been programming since 2019. I started with **python** development, then passed a serious selection process and went to [School 21](https://21-school.ru) ([Ecole 42](https://www.42.fr) association). My curriculum is built on C and C++, but I also got to know some additional topics:

* Data Analysis - I took a [course](http://coursera.org/verify/9B7VA4FZPG4M) from Yandex and MIPT and have basic knowledge of working with *Pandas*, *NumPy*, *SciPy*, *MatplotLib*, and similar packages
* SQL - I [learned](https://coursera.org/share/50ee1bcd836b31d2be594056d074ebe8) basic ways to create *sql-queries*, *join tables*, and *construct databases*
* Mobile development - After studying a [course](https://coursera.org/share/0f3b5e88ced804ba5889522a03493cac) on development in **Kotlin**, I began to better understand *OOP*, *functional programming*, and even wrote my *[own](https://github.com/zkerriga/tritri) application*


I'm currently [studying](https://stepik.org/cert/911798) **Scala** to work in the financial technology field that interests me!
